        <p>My name is Nicolas M. Careau. Born in Qu√©bec/Canada, I am a native French speaker but quickly learned the English language in order to play video games. I've been an avid gamer ever since I got my Super Nintendo when I was 5. Played professionally for some time and then got a job for one of the biggest video game publisher in the world.</p>
        <p>I am a self-taught programmer who tries to build application and games for everyone to enjoy. I also like to watch lots of TV Shows and movies. I thinker/repair/hack everything I can ameliorate to use in my life. My goal is to share my experience in the gaming and technology industry, my success and my failures alike.</p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy your stay and don't hesitate to contact me if you want.</p>
