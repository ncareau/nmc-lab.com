<h3>Intro</h3>

Today, I will be proudly displaying my beast of a Media Center. I've had this machine for about a year now and I'm
currently very happy of how it is right now, enough to talk about it. This machine, called "Swordfish" , is my main
living room's PC and connected directly into the main TV. We don't have Cable or SAT so a massive hard drive hold
all of our TV shows and movie, around 12TB of usable space. We also game on it, playing the 2d and retro game directly
on the AMD APU, and streaming 'graphics heavy' games using the Steam In-House streaming.

<h4>Storage</h4>

<br/><br/>
I decided to go with a dual storage option, where the SSD host the OS and Apps while the media files are on the HDDs.
This has worked very good for me since when i had minor issues with the raid drive, i was still able to boot up the OS and
make diagnostic on the drives. It also allows for quick boot up time and super fast applications.

<br/><br/>

This is what my machine was about, a huge space to store movies, TV Shows, games and everything i could gather on
the internet. Plug these in a raid 5 and you get 12TB drive with pretty fast read and write speed even with the M/B
onboard controller. It is quite costly (about the same as all the other pieces together), but I suggest you buy them
all when you build the computer, because it is difficult (almost impossible) to change the size of the array once
configured without losing data. Although if you plan to build one yourself, it is entirely up to you to decide of
the size of the drive.<br/>
<br/>
These also have a great warranty of 5 year where, if a drive fails for any reason, you can cross-ship it (meaning
that they send you one before you can send it back) This proves useful when you have one drive starting to fail, you
can still use the array while waiting for the drive to arrive and then switch immediately.<br/>

<h4>Building It</h4>

The biggest problem i had was the freaking small case and don't get me wrong, the case is very slick and i love
the small footprint/feature ratio, but it is very difficult to work with. To install everything in this case you
absolutely need to take everything apart first. For example, In order to change just the optical drive, you will
need to remove all components of the case including the motherboard. For that reason, I used&nbsp;<span
        style="background-color: white;">a completely modular power supply, even the big ATX connector, so that&nbsp;</span>I
can easily remove the unit without having to disconnect any cable on the board. It's quite a tight fit so you
don't want to have to open it often.<br/>
<br/>
The 7 slots of hard drive are really practical and when completed, the case looks awesome inside and out. I
have also recently added custom SATA power cables and blue Sata III cables from monoprice.com. Here are a few
photos of the finished product.&nbsp;

<h2>Software</h2>
<br/>
<b>Raid 5</b><br/>
Before i bought this machine a year ago, the question of soft/hard raid was haunting me. Wheter to use linux
mraid or anything else. Since i decided to use Windows as my primary OS, I decided to use the Onboard Raid
Controller which, as you can see above, is quite fast. One of the big issue with this method though, is that if
the motherboard gets fried, you will need to replace with the same model or else you will lose the Raid
array.<br/>
<br/>
<b>OS &amp; Apps</b><br/>
Decided to go with Windows because it's the OS i'm more confortable with. For the main interface, i use Steam Big
Picture and XBMC for easier navigation as both work with an X360 controller as the main input. I still use keyboard and
mouse for internet surfing and also to manage the computer and it's media files.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://sickbeard.com/">Sickbeard</a> is the main TV organizer. With it, I'm able to track every TV Show i want by the day. I use a custom
build provided by Bricky Box that you can find on his blog : <a href="http://brickybox.com/2013/05/09/sickbeard-with-integrated-torrent-client">brickybox.com/2013/05/09/sickbeard-with-integrated-torrent-client</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Gaming</b>
<br/>
As you can see, there is no GPU card in this setup. With the new feature on Steam called In-Home streaming, The
lack of a GPU card doesn't really matter. I can easily stream games from my main office PC and i got almost no
lag while being at full settings. And while the APU isnt the best for gaming, it is comparable to a 7660D which
is quite able to play 2d games like Castle&nbsp;Crasher, Pixel Junk, Hearthstone or any emulator. Of course,
once the streaming won't be able to satisfied my needs, i will probably add a card for gaming.
<br/>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

    I have been using this setup for more than a year now and I can't recommend thios enough, it has been really
    great for me.&nbsp;
