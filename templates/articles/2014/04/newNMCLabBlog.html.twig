Hello Everyone. This blog post is about my new blog design and the technology used to built it. The site is built around the idea of no active database like MySQL or PGSQL. I use git feature for my editing needs, branching for new article and merging when completed. The hosting is done on AWS for a more scabale environment.


The site is built in PHP and use silex as the framework.
