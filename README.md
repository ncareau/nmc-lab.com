## Info
The blog is built without an active database. For all editing needs, I use git features to branch, edit and merge
articles. It allows me to have complete control over the website and all i need is my trusty IDE. Sometimes not having
 an interface can be difficult and it takes a little longer to write HTML, but it's easier to get the exact format and
 functionality that I want.

See [this post](https://nmc-lab.com/2014/04/new-version-nmc-lab-blog/) for more information on the website. Any
suggestion of feedback is appreciated.
