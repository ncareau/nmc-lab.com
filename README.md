## Info
The blog is built without an active database. For all editing needs, I use git features to branch, edit and merge articles. It allows me to have complete control over the website and all i need is my trusty IDE. Sometimes not having an interface can be difficult and it takes a little longer to write HTML, but it's easier to get the exact format and functionality that I want.
