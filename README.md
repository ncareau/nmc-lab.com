## Info
The blkog is built without a database. Since i use git quite regurlaly, I'm using it to edit my articles. I create branch for a new article and merge article when they are completed. It allows me to have complete control over the website and all i need is my favorite IDE. Sometimes not having an interface can be difficult but you since you write in HTML, it's easier to get the exact format that you want.

## Config & Install
composer must be isntalled.
